# Trading Specific Algorithms

Review the Binance European Options API documentation at [binance voptions](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/voptions/en/).

Then:

- Retrieve data from the endpoint:
  ```
  GET /eapi/v1/ticker
  ```

- Write a parsing algorithm for the instrument statistics and print the result

- Measure the parsing speed for a single entry and evaluate the algorithmic complexity
of your approach. Document any potential optimizations aimed at achieving low
latency.
