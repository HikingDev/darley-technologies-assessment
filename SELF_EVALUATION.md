# Self Evaluation

## Rust Experience
6/10 (I’ve worked with Rust since 2015 on both personal and professional projects, including parallelizing configuration loading and building a REST API library.
However, I’m still deepening my expertise in certain areas like async/await, unsafe code, etc.)

# Idiomatic Rust
6/10 (I’m comfortable leveraging ownership/borrowing, enums, match statements, iterators, and Result/Option.
I prioritize moves over copies where possible and strive for a functional programming style where it makes sense.)
